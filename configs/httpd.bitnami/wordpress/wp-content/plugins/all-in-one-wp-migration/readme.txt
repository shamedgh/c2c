Move, transfer, copy, migrate, and backup a site with 1-click. Quick, easy, and reliable.

== Description ==
This plugin exports your WordPress website including the database, media files, plugins and themes with no technical knowledge required.
Upload your site to a different location with a drag and drop in to WordPress.
There is an option to apply an unlimited number of find and replace operations on your database during the export process. The plugin will also fix any
serialisation problems that occur during the find/replace operation.

Mobile device compatible: All-in-One WP Migration is the first plugin to offer true mobile experience on WordPress versions 3.3 and up.

= No limitations on host or operating system =
* We have tested the plugin on the major Linux distributions, MacOS and Microsoft Windows.
* [Please see the list of hosting providers that we work with.](https://help.servmask.com/knowledgebase/supported-hosting-providers/)

= Bypass all upload size restriction =
* We use chunks to import your site data. Most providers set the maximum upload file size to 2MB. As the file restrictions are only applied to each chunk, webserver upload size restrictions are bypassed by keeping the chunks under 2MB to easily upload your entire site.

= Zero Dependencies =
* The plugin does not require any PHP extensions and works with all versions of PHP from v5.2 onwards. This is great news for v5.2 users who are unsupported by many other products.

= Support for MySQL and MySQLi =
* No matter what php mysql driver your webserver ships with, we support it.

= Compatible with WordPress v3.3 to present =
* We have a comprehensive Quality Assurance and testing process that ensures that the plugin is always compatible with the latest release of WordPress, but we don't support versions of WordPress prior to version 3.3 (2012)

= WP-CLI Integration is available in Unlimited Extension =
